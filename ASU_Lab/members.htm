			<h1>  Prof. Alberto Behar, Director </h1>			
			<p>
				Dr.  Behar has over 20 years of experience in planetary flight projects and research and development of extreme environment robotics and instruments for planetary (including Earth) science and engineering applications. He has developed instruments and robotics that have reached deep in the ocean's hydrothermal vents, next to volcanoes, under thick ice sheets, to the south pole, in to the stratosphere and on to other planetary bodies (asteroids/Mars). He is an Airline Transport Pilot and Instructor in Helicopters and Airplanes with a Gulfstream 5 Type Rating. He is also a Scientific and Rescue SCUBA diver. His primary interests are developing, testing and deploying architectures for Earth exploration and future planetary surface spacecraft in remote extreme environments on Earth.

			<h1>Emily McBryan, Aerospace Engineer</h1>
			<p>
				Emily McBryan is an Aerospace engineer with a passion for robotics. She started competing in robot competitions in high school with FIRST robotics and being a member of team 1212. Upon entering ASU, she joined the NASA Space Grant Robotics Team competing in the underwater NURC and MATE robot competitions. She has been an avid member for four years and is now a NASA Space Grant senior intern and president of the team. This internship with NASA Space Grant aided her in receiving an internship at NASA Johnson Space Center in the spring of 2011. From this opportunity, she was able to work in the Robonaut II lab assembling R2 forearms and enhancing previous technology to be used towards new projects with mentors Johnathon Rogers and Lyndon Bridgwater. Emily loves robotics and how they can be used for exploring locations that would otherwise be impossible to reach. She loves being part of a team and learning from others. After completion of undergrad, Emily will continue towards her masters.
